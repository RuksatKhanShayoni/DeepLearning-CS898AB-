Question 1: Dataset Preparation
- Get Tiny ImageNet 200 dataset
- Create your own dataset from the ILSVRC2010 dataset as follows:
o Consider only 100 classes from the dataset
o From each class, take 500 images
o Split your dataset into training, testing, and validation sets such that training
set contains 30,000, testing contains, 10,000, and validation set contains
10,000 images
o Prepare your data for your model as described in section 2 of AlexNet paper.
o Important: You code must have appropriate comments.
