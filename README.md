Question 2: Experiments on Non-Linear Activation Function

- Your dataset for this experiment is CIFAR-10. This dataset is readily available on all deep learning framework like (PyTorch, TensorFlow).
- Create a four-layer convolutional Neural Network for CIFAR-10 dataset and do the experiments to get the similar graph.
- Train your network until you get <= 25% training error. Once your training error reaches 25% stop your training.
- Note: You need to create two experiments with “ReLU”, “Tanh”, “Sigmoid” activation function s in the hidden layers.
- You also need to report the time required for each epoch for all trainings. Place both graphs on same figure. Note, your x-axis should hold number of epoch and y-axis should
  hold time (in second) for each epoch.
- Write a report that should describe your approach and contain your original results from your experiments. Also, you should require to explain the results in well manner.
